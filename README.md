# Bullet-Hell
 
Bullet Hell is a shoot'em up in which enemy bullets frequently almost entirely fill the entire screen. A game in which the protagonist combats a large number of enemies by shooting at them while dodging their fire. The controlling player must rely primarily on reaction times to succeed. This type of game is often referred to as "curtain shooting," "manic shooters" or "maniac shooters."
